Feature: Provisioning

  Scenario: Fail2ban test for wazo-provd
    Given the latest plugin "wazo-aastra" is installed
    Given the file "/var/log/wazo-provd-fail2ban.log" is empty
    When the following devices are created via HTTP requests to the provisioning server:
      | mac               | path                    | user-agent                                        |
      | 00:11:22:33:44:55 | Aastra/001122334455.cfg | Aastra6863i MAC:00-11-22-33-44-55 V:4.1.0.128-SIP |
    Then fail2ban-regex for "wazo-provd" matches 2 lines

  Scenario: Synchronize two devices behind NAT
    Given the latest plugin "wazo-aastra" is installed
    Given there are devices with infos:
      | mac               | latest plugin of |
      | 00:11:22:33:44:01 | wazo-aastra      |
      | 00:11:22:33:44:02 | wazo-aastra      |
    Given there are telephony users with infos:
      | firstname | lastname | exten | context | protocol | device            |
      | User      | 01       | 1001  | default | sip      | 00:11:22:33:44:01 |
      | User      | 02       | 1002  | default | sip      | 00:11:22:33:44:02 |
    Given the following devices are created via HTTP requests to the provisioning server:
      | path                    | user-agent                                         |
      | Aastra/001122334401.cfg | Aastra6731i MAC:00-11-22-33-44-01 V:3.2.2.1136-SIP |
      | Aastra/001122334402.cfg | Aastra6731i MAC:00-11-22-33-44-02 V:3.2.2.1136-SIP |
    When I synchronize the device with mac "00:11:22:33:44:01"
    Then I see in the AMI that the line "1001@default" has been synchronized
    When I synchronize the device with mac "00:11:22:33:44:02"
    Then I see in the AMI that the line "1002@default" has been synchronized

Feature: User Forward

  Scenario: Change unconditional forward from phone
    Given there are telephony users with infos:
      | firstname | lastname | exten  | context |
      | James     | Bond     | 1101   | default |
    When "James Bond" calls "*211102" and waits until the end
    Then "James Bond" has an "unconditional" forward set to "1102"
    When "James Bond" calls "*211103" and waits until the end
    Then "James Bond" has an "unconditional" forward set to "1103"
    When "James Bond" calls "*21" and waits until the end
    Then "James Bond" has no "unconditional" forward
    When "James Bond" calls "*211102" and waits until the end
    Then "James Bond" has an "unconditional" forward set to "1102"
    When "James Bond" calls "*211102" and waits until the end
    Then "James Bond" has no "unconditional" forward

  Scenario: When two users configure a forward loop the call does not get stuck
    Given there are telephony users with infos:
      | firstname | lastname | exten | context |
      | Mia       | Wallace  | 1001  | default |
      | Vincent   | Vega     | 1002  | default |
    Given "Mia Wallace" has an "unconditional" forward set to "1002"
    Given "Vincent Vega" has an "unconditional" forward set to "1001"
    When "Mia Wallace" calls "1002" and waits "120" seconds to be hung up
    Then "Mia Wallace" is hungup
